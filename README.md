##Installation

1. Import the latest release into makecode, using the method in the below box or do the same thing, but click "import file" and download the .hex of the latest release. click "choose file" and find the .hex file, it will create a new project

2. Change the messages the device sends. It should say (user): "message". change the part saying (user) to your name.

2.5 (not required) If you want, change the messages sent

3. Download the Hex file, put on your microbit a ask your friends if they want to buy a microbit and use it! 

Disclaimer: only designed for short communication between 2 people and for across school/workplace communication with multiple people in the area to daisy chain messages around


Basic instructions (once it is set up):

Button A sends the message "Ok".

Button B sends the message "nearby" (despite being a short range comms device, nearby could be used to say "I can see you from where I am").

The microbit logo sends "SOS" and so you're sure it's been sent, SOS in morse code will play.

When shaken, the device will repeatedly send "SOS" and play SOS in morse code so you can be located by sound once your friends/family etc are near enough (useful if you fall and can't send SOS).

The microbit will make a long high pitched beep when a message arrives.
