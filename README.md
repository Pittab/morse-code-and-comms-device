## Blocks preview

Basic instructions:
Button A sends the message "Ok"
Button B sends the message "nearby" (despite being a short range comms device, nearby could be used to say "I can see you from where I am")
The microbit logo sends "SOS" and so you're sure it's been sent, SOS in morse code will play
When shaken, the device will repeatedly send "SOS" and play SOS in morse code so you can be located by sound once your friends/family etc are near enough
The microbit will make a long high pitched beep when a message arrives
